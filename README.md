🧮 Collatz Conjecture Calculator

    A tool for exploring and researching numerical patterns within the Collatz Conjecture.
    Built with C++, this project aims to visualize, compare, and analyze the paths numbers take through the Collatz process.



🚀 Current Features

    ✅ Console Interface — Basic user input and iteration through Collatz steps

    ✅ Step Counting — Displays the total steps taken until 1

    ⚙️ File Separation & Modular Design — Organized header and source files



🧭 Planned Features

    🖥️ Graphical Interface (SFML) — Visualize paths and patterns in real time

    📊 Graphing System — Render number sequences, peaks, and loops

    🔢 Multi-Number Input Mode — Run and compare sets of numbers simultaneously

    💾 Dynamic Memory Saving — Cache previously explored paths for faster computation

    🔍 Path Matching — Identify shared patterns or convergence between sequences

    🧩 Prime Connection Analysis — Explore correlations between Collatz paths and prime numbers



🧠 Purpose

    This project is not intended to solve the Collatz conjecture but to provide a research platform for identifying emergent structures, relationships, and computational efficiencies.
    The long-term goal is to build a self-learning system that recognizes previously calculated sequences and applies them to future computations.
